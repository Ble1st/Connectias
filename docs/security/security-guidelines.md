# Security Guidelines

## Overview

Connectias implements a comprehensive security framework designed to protect against modern threats while maintaining high performance and usability. Our security model is built on the principle of defense in depth, with multiple layers of protection.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP)

Connectias includes a built-in RASP monitor that provides real-time threat detection and response:

- **Certificate Transparency Verification**: Validates certificates against public CT logs
- **Certificate Pinning**: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Threat Detection**: Monitors for suspicious plugin behavior
- **Real-time Alerts**: Immediate notification of security incidents

### 2. Plugin Sandboxing

All plugins run in isolated WASM environments with strict resource limits:

- **Memory Isolation**: Each plugin has its own memory space
- **CPU Limits**: Prevents resource exhaustion attacks
- **Fuel Metering**: Stops infinite loops and runaway processes
- **Permission System**: Granular access control for system resources

### 3. Network Security

Comprehensive network security measures protect against various attack vectors:

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All network communication must use HTTPS
- **Certificate Pinning**: Validates server certificates against known good hashes
- **CT Log Verification**: Additional certificate validation through public logs
- **Domain Allowlisting**: Restricts network access to approved domains

## Security Features

### Certificate Transparency (CT)

Connectias verifies certificates against multiple CT logs:

- **Google CT Log**: `https://ct.googleapis.com/logs/argon2024/ct/v1/get-entries`
- **Cloudflare CT Log**: `https://ct.cloudflare.com/logs/nimbus2024/ct/v1/get-entries`
- **DigiCert CT Log**: `https://ct1.digicert-ct.com/log/ct/v1/get-entries`
- **Sectigo CT Log**: `https://ct.sectigo.com/log/ct/v1/get-entries`
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Continues operation if CT logs are unavailable
- **Caching**: 60-minute TTL for CT log responses to improve performance

**Note**: CT Log endpoints are subject to change. Verify current endpoints at:
- [Google CT Logs](https://www.gstatic.com/ct/log_list/v3/log_list.json)
- [Cloudflare CT Logs](https://ct.cloudflare.com/logs/nimbus2024/ct/v1/get-sth)

### Certificate Pinning

Implements SHA-256 SPKI pinning for critical connections:

```dart
// Example configuration
// WARNUNG: Die folgenden Certificate Pins sind PLACEHOLDER und müssen durch echte SHA-256 SPKI Hashes ersetzt werden!
// Um echte SPKI Hashes zu erhalten:
// 1. Extrahieren Sie den öffentlichen Schlüssel aus dem Server-Zertifikat
// 2. Berechnen Sie den SHA-256 Hash des SPKI (Subject Public Key Info)
// 3. Kodieren Sie das Ergebnis in Base64
// Tools: openssl x509 -in cert.pem -pubkey -noout | openssl pkey -pubin -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | openssl enc -base64
final policy = NetworkSecurityPolicy(
  enforceHttps: true,
  certificatePins: [
    'sha256/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=', // PLACEHOLDER - ersetzen Sie durch echten SPKI Hash
    'sha256/BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB=', // PLACEHOLDER - ersetzen Sie durch echten SPKI Hash
  ],
  enableCertificateTransparency: true,
);
```

### WASM Security

WebAssembly provides strong isolation guarantees:

- **Memory Bounds Checking**: Prevents buffer overflow attacks
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time type checking prevents many vulnerabilities
- **Sandboxed Execution**: No direct system access
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory limits per plugin

### Permission System

Granular permission model for plugin access:

```rust
// Example permissions
pub enum PluginPermission {
    NetworkAccess,
    FileSystemRead,
    FileSystemWrite,
    SystemInfo,
    UserData,
    Camera,
    Microphone,
    Location,
}
```

## Threat Detection

### Real-time Monitoring

The RASP monitor continuously watches for:

- **Suspicious Network Activity**: Unusual connection patterns
- **Resource Abuse**: Excessive CPU or memory usage
- **Permission Escalation**: Attempts to access unauthorized resources
- **Code Injection**: Attempts to inject malicious code

### Alert Levels

- **Low**: Minor security events that are logged
- **Medium**: Suspicious activity requiring attention
- **High**: Potential security threats requiring immediate action
- **Critical**: Active attacks requiring emergency response

### Response Actions

When threats are detected, Connectias can:

- **Block Network Requests**: Prevent malicious network activity
- **Suspend Plugins**: Temporarily disable suspicious plugins
- **Revoke Permissions**: Remove access to sensitive resources
- **Generate Alerts**: Notify administrators of security incidents

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input
2. **Error Handling**: Never expose sensitive information in error messages
3. **Secure Coding**: Follow secure coding practices and guidelines
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies and libraries up to date
5. **Code Review**: Implement mandatory security code reviews

### For Administrators

1. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and assessments
2. **Access Control**: Implement principle of least privilege
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor security logs and alerts regularly
4. **Incident Response**: Have a clear incident response plan
5. **Backup Security**: Ensure backup systems are equally secure

### For Users

1. **Plugin Sources**: Only install plugins from trusted sources
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep Connectias and plugins updated
3. **Permission Review**: Regularly review plugin permissions
4. **Suspicious Activity**: Report any suspicious behavior immediately
5. **Strong Authentication**: Use strong, unique passwords
