## Security Features

### Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP)

- **Certificate Transparency Verification**: Validates certificates against public CT logs
- **Certificate Pinning**: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks with SHA-256 SPKI pinning
- **Threat Detection**: Real-time monitoring for suspicious plugin behavior
- **Automated Response**: Immediate action on detected threats

### Plugin Sandboxing

- **WASM Isolation**: Each plugin runs in its own WebAssembly sandbox
- **Memory Bounds Checking**: Prevents buffer overflow attacks
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory limits per plugin
- **Fuel Metering**: Stops infinite loops and runaway processes

### Network Security

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All network communication must use HTTPS
- **Certificate Validation**: Multi-layer certificate verification
- **Domain Allowlisting**: Restricts access to approved domains
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous network activity monitoring
