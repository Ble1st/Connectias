Licenses for External Libraries
===============================

This project uses the following external libraries, built from source:

1. libdvdread
   - Source: https://code.videolan.org/videolan/libdvdread
   - License: GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 or later.
   - File: libdvdread/COPYING

2. libdvdnav
   - Source: https://code.videolan.org/videolan/libdvdnav
   - License: GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 or later.
   - File: libdvdnav/COPYING

Note on strict compliance:
Since these libraries are GPL, linking them statically into 'libdvd_jni.so' requires that the 'libdvd_jni.so' (and effectively the app) complies with GPL requirements (releasing source code, etc.).
If LGPL is preferred, ensure you are using the LGPL versions/flags if available, or link dynamically.
Check the specific 'COPYING' files in each subdirectory for details.
